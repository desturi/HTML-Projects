    <h1>Welcome to Mount Kailash Wikipedia</h1>
    <h2>Below are some of the highlights of this Hiking Journey</h2>
    <p>Our group were blessed with this hiking journey or spritiual yatra. It was one of the best lifetime experience. It's a four days journey and we touch the elevation of 18,500 ft. The four-day Parikrama including the Charan Sparsh (Touch Kailash's Feet), was a profound spiritual journey. Our Parikrama began at Darchen, leading us to Dirapuk, Charan Sparsh, back to Dirapuk, over the Dolma La Pass, through Zutulpuk, and finally returning to Darchen, covering a total distance of over 45 KMs. We hiked most of the time, while on the last day, we combined hiking with riding a pony. Each day presented significant challenges due to the high altitude, rough terrain, and limited resources.  </p>
